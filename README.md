 Also, whenever I look at the github.io's of websites, it's mildly annoying how there's never a link to the actual website, so you have to search it up. Oh no, +5 seconds! Anyways, here's the link:

 <h1> https://antimatter543.github.io/ </h1>
 
 Jekyll makes it so that instead of having to change URLS, etc. for every single site, you can make a default.html and then import that into the index, etc. And that's just one of the things it can do! PogChamp.
