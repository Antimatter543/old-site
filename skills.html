SKILL POGCHAMP WHAT DO I HAVE
Idk what am I meant to put here. Well, obviously I could have a projects link (because projects are a pretty good indicator of skill and interest)
but stuff like certificates, achievements (or should that be a different page).

<div class="skills">
<ol>
	<li class ='skillset'> Certificates </li>
	<ul>
		<div class='padding'>
		<li> Introduction to Quantum Computing Certificate, by Qubit x Qubit (October 2020-May 2021; 2 Semesters)</li>
		<li> Deep Learning Specialisation (Coursera) </li>
		<ol type="I"> 
			<li> Neural Nets and Deep Learning</li>
			<li> Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization </li>
			<li> Structuring Machine Learning Projects </li>
		</ol>
		</div>
	</ul>
	<li class='skillset'> Placeholder for different type of skills set</li>
	<ul>

	</ul>
</ol>
</div>
