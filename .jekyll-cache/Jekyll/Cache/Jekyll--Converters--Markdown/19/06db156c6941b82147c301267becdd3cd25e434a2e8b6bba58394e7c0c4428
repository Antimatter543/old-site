I"d	<p>Will be edited and refined later on, I just wanted to actually put something here.
Editor’s Note (19/11/20): This can also be viewed as perspective change, / changing perspectives. If you read the following below and aren’t thinking about perspective changing, then… Er… I’m not sure what you’re thinking about.</p>

<p>Also, if I killed myself, I wouldn’t even be dead. Since the concept of ‘you’ exists for all conscious entities, ‘you’ can only experience yourself. I had this thought sometime in primary school, and it was wild. The fact that every conscious entity only experiences their own perceptions implies that ‘you’ are everyone. You only have awareness of your own life, and act in your own life. But that’s just it.
<br />
That’s the thing for every single human (and conscious being), that is living, has lived and will live for the entire existence of the universe. I.e you only experience you, but that’s the case for everyone. So if ‘you’ died, of course you didn’t! You’re alive, you were born by X. You never know that person who just died, who also identified as ‘you’.</p>

<p>That’s the thing then. Killing yourself doesn’t rid you of this world. It only makes you hop consciousness. You are everyone, everyone is you. There is only one you in the world. That is you. For instance, if I killed myself now, would I be free? Would there be eternal darkness? Fuck no! I’d be you! Because you are a conscious entity who identities themselves as ‘me’.</p>

<p>{Killing yourself is literally useless because of the above. So you might as well do what you want to with the free will you’ve been given. And if you don’t believe in free will, go cry in a hole or some shit. 28/3/21}.</p>

<p>This means that death is impossible unless all conscious entites are gone for all of time. Because if everyone died now, but some alien dude 100 billion years from now came up and had consciousness. You would be them, still fucking alive. You aren’t dead motherfucker! And you wouldn’t know about any of your past, just that you are you.  And you’re gonna live a life, then die. But you’ll still be alive if there’s another conscious entity.</p>

<p>What a fucking universe dude. I believe this is a similar situation to ‘The egg’ by Kurzgesagt. Mmm, this felt good. Playing with this idea has always been interesting.</p>
