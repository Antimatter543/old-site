<!-- I'd like to minimise the number of regrets I have during my lifetime. I have some goals I'd like to achieve, so that's what I'm aiming for.

This website was created around February 2021 after some re-prioritising of goals. This site was built from scratch, following tutorials and *creative inspiration* from multiple other sites, as well as my own code + personal twists to things. Some of the canvas creations are mine, some aren't. All required effort to learn + implement (turns out learning a new language isn't that bad!). As someone who's dabbled in novel creating, it astounds me how much your own 'creativity' is lowkey just plagiarising off 200 different sources (and you notice it in every other text then). 

You'll notice that some of the blog posts are pre-2021. Those are the original dates that I had explored that concepts -- most recent date touched is shown inside the article.

If you're here for professional reasons, check out my skills / projects / blog posts.

If you're here to potentially learn, or to see someone else's experiences with something, check out the non-professional blog section. I've written about a few things which I'm quite pleased with, so check it out :). In there, you'll find some nice morals or lessons to learn, some tips for living and enjoying the limited time of consciousness you have. Sometimes I go into a bit of a philosophical tangent too, so there's that if you want. Obviously, you don't have to take away any topics, but just try playing around with them in your head: adapt the ideas to your model of reality -- evaluate it against your own, change what works and what doesn't.

This website has started in February 2021, after I re-organised my life priorities & goals in January of 2021. Before this, I didn't really do any extra-curriculum things and instead let time drag me around as it wished. Now, I at least try to do things that I think are meaningful or fun. Maybe I will fail, but I'll at least try, which is probably more than what some could say.
	
	I'll consider 2021 to be the first year where I actually began delving into programming as more than just a school subject (which we barely learnt anything from). 
	
	I.e as of 2021, I am a 0 year old programmer. In 2022, I'll be a 1 year old programmer :D 
	
	If you want my experience as a programmer:
	 2017: Introduced to html as a thing - made a really bad website for our school assessment (no deployment, just html & css).
	 2018: Introduced to python - if statements, bools.
	 2019 - Gamemaker games (oh hey, it's Frame of War :o)
	 2020 - Understood what functions were, did some at-home research.
Year 2021 - Began delving into AI - starting from Kaggle's AI course and onwards. (My skills have already increased dramatically from the beginning of this year)

### Some resources I used to make this site (inspiration, tutorials, etc.)

This site has been <em> creatively inspired </em> by many other websites (>7), similar to how every story is effectively a plagiarised mess of all the stories anyone has ever read, but I'll name the first few that have been inspired from the most :
- karpathy.github.io
- https://www.christopherlovell.co.uk/
-  Jekyll Minima 
-  https://github.com/hankquinlan/hankquinlan.github.io/
