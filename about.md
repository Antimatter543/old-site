I'd like to minimise the number of regrets I have during my lifetime. I have some goals I'd like to achieve, so that's what I'm aiming for.

This website was created around February 2021, and is continually updated as I... update it.
However, you'll notice that some of the blog posts are pre-2021. This is just because that's the date when I had originally explored the concept. 
If you click on the article, the most recent date where it's been reviewed will show (which is when it was published here).

If you're here for professional reasons, check out my skills / projects / blog posts (professional only).

If you're here to potentially learn, or to see someone else's experiences with something, check out the non-professional blog section. I've written about a few things which I'm quite pleased with, so check it out :). In there, you'll find some nice morals or lessons to learn, some tips for living and enjoying the limited time of consciousness you have. Sometimes I go into a bit of a philosophical tangent too, so there's that if you want. Obviously, you don't have to take away any topics, but just try playing around with them in your head: adapt the ideas to your model of reality -- evaluate it against your own, change what works and what doesn't.
