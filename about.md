<!-- # WIP  -->
<!-- Unfortunately, I've had to hunt most extra-curricular projects and experiences as I've never really had anyone who pushed me, encouraged me, to do things that would bring me outside my comfort zone and force me to learn, evolve. For instance, nobody told me to make a site. Nobody introduced me to programming or gamemaking or AI. And to those in a similar boat; respect. It's not easy when there's nobody else to talk about your projects to, right? 

Of course, people that have been encouraged by a teacher or family member or friend will have faced their own struggles too (ofc). I have partially being taught -- by a rigid school system that somehow took the fun and creativity out of coding in grades 9 onwards, but it was very superficial and we really didn't do anything past booleans and conditionals for the most part. Trust in school to do that, huh?

But the thing I love about computers and programming is that, it doesn't care. What a computer is designed to do is logical operations, and in these operations lies the means of effectively unlimited creativity. It doesn't care whether you're disabled, academic, have 50 prestigious titles or are a 12 year old located in some rural part of Africa. Build it, program it, and it will happen.
The *potential* of creation is simply a great attractor to me.

ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I'm Anti (or Yuv), and among other things, I like programming things. I'm currently 17 and finishing up my last year of high school, and I've been exploring programming at an increasingly complex (perhaps exponential) rate since Year 10 (and by that, I mean the first two years were *extremely* slow relative to my current pace). Obviously, nature doesn't like exponentials for too long and it only looks exponential because of the small time frame. I love the idea of freedom, creativity and also raw power that turing complete machines can give, and how its system of information processing is independent from the material substrate it's founded upon (anything that can make a NAND gate is equivalent to any other computing device). Basically, programming is cool.

I'm most likely to go into a Machine Learning career, but the nature of my goal is action-based and not profession-based. Realistically, the closest jobs that align with the goal I want to achieve are probably researching @ Deepmind / OpenAI or somewhere similar or making a seriously good VR game that somehow beats the problem of converting reality motion -> simulated motion whilst keeping the reality user in one spot + producing the expected effects of movement.

I also have a problem of biting off more than I can chew (I'll keep doing it, though) and trying to learn way too much in way too little time (it's not my fault there's so many interestings things out there). It's fun everytime though!



Current things I'm doing (kinda) - but I've procrastinated/wasted weeks of time :) / haven't touched in a while
- Make posts for blog have a picture attached to each of them so they display in the blog list.
- Also get tags to work where you can filter by tags for blog list.
- Learning kotlin
- Learning unity game development + coding in C# => Evade game, simple roguelike?
- Very casual leetcoding
- Reading
- Udacity AWS ML Course
- Creating a simple handwriting (single symbol) recognition neural network
- School ( ~_~ ) 
- Create a simple 3x+1 that goes to infinite, trying to find a number that disproves it. (Just a simple checker). DONE
- Writing a book (currently ~30000 words), started 1/3/20, have periods of ON/TO BE CONTINUED (most of it is TBC'd). This'll take a while to finish.

Things that might be interesting :
- Creating a visualisation of the travelling salesperson problem & heuristics to solve it 
- Cellular automata?
- AICrowd Neural MMO Challenge
- Really trying in some kaggle / AIcrowd competition. (Lux AI?)
- MLSEC.io - https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/07/29/attack-ai-systems-in-machine-learning-evasion-competition/ August 6th - September 17th
https://mlsec.io/
-  ML Generative music


I might have too much to want to do... And I'm really slow at doing things in the first place, but I want to do everything and end up doing little (kinda). Anybody know how to fix this problem?


Test below:
 - [ ] An uncompleted task
- [x] A completed task

<!-- I'd like to minimise the number of regrets I have during my lifetime. I have some goals I'd like to achieve, so that's what I'm aiming for.

This website was created around February 2021 after some re-prioritising of goals. This site was built from scratch, following tutorials and *creative inspiration* from multiple other sites, as well as my own code + personal twists to things. Some of the canvas creations are mine, some aren't. All required effort to learn + implement (turns out learning a new language isn't that bad!). As someone who's dabbled in novel creating, it astounds me how much your own 'creativity' is lowkey just plagiarising off 200 different sources (and you notice it in every other text then). 

You'll notice that some of the blog posts are pre-2021. Those are the original dates that I had explored that concepts -- most recent date touched is shown inside the article.

If you're here for professional reasons, check out my skills / projects / blog posts.

If you're here to potentially learn, or to see someone else's experiences with something, check out the non-professional blog section. I've written about a few things which I'm quite pleased with, so check it out :). In there, you'll find some nice morals or lessons to learn, some tips for living and enjoying the limited time of consciousness you have. Sometimes I go into a bit of a philosophical tangent too, so there's that if you want. Obviously, you don't have to take away any topics, but just try playing around with them in your head: adapt the ideas to your model of reality -- evaluate it against your own, change what works and what doesn't. 


//////

This website has started in February 2021, after I re-organised my life priorities & goals in January of 2021. Before this, I didn't really do any extra-curriculum things and instead let time drag me around as it wished. Now, I at least try to do things that I think are meaningful or fun. Maybe I will fail, but I'll at least try, which is probably more than what some could say.
	
	I'll consider 2021 to be the first year where I actually began delving into programming as more than just a school subject (which we barely learnt anything from). 
	
	I.e as of 2021, I am a 0 year old programmer. In 2022, I'll be a 1 year old programmer :D 
	
	If you want my experience as a programmer:
	 2017: Introduced to html as a thing - made a really bad website for our school assessment (no deployment, just html & css).
	 2018: Introduced to python - if statements, bools.
	 2019 - Gamemaker games (oh hey, it's Frame of War :o)
	 2020 - Understood what functions were, did some at-home research.
Year 2021 - Began delving into AI - starting from Kaggle's AI course and onwards. (My skills have already increased dramatically from the beginning of this year)

### Some resources I used to make this site (inspiration, tutorials, etc.)

This site has been <em> creatively inspired </em> by many other websites (>7), similar to how every story is effectively a plagiarised mess of all the stories anyone has ever read, but I'll name the first few that have been inspired from the most :
- karpathy.github.io
- https://www.christopherlovell.co.uk/
-  Jekyll Minima 
-  https://github.com/hankquinlan/hankquinlan.github.io/
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EO6OkltgudE
