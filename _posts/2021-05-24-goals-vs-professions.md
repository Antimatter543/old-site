*Might  be a blog post, when we have [], it should be text that pops up above the immediately preceding text. E.g the word ‘shallow’, if you hovered over it, would show [Shallow, does not necessarily…].*


It seems that when people often ask the question “What do you want to be in life?”, or “What do you want to do in life”, the implied assumption is that you will answer it in terms of what profession you want to do, and not actually what you want to do. At least this was my experience when I randomly asked them.

For instance, if I asked someone what they wanted to do in life, they would most likely say something like, “I want to be a doctor”, “I’d like to be a optometrist”, airforce pilot, software engineer, etc. [Interestingly, children usually respond to this question with “I’m going to be …!” – it seems elders understand that having only one path is probably not the best. Although, there is something unique and potentially incredibly beneficial that is lost when that stubbornness disappears. Personally, I seem to have kept that stubbornness.]

They’ve locked on to a profession of their choosing (or perhaps not), and that’s their go-to response. They might change it later, but what they are doing right now will probably be to achieve that profession. I should point out that specific professions (such as doctors) can in fact be a goal – i.e, professions are a subset of goals (The idea of A being subsets of B is very useful, and I’ll use it often throughout my writings). You could become a doctor simply because you wanted to. That is your goal. No further reasoning.

However, the truth (as always), is usually not as shallow [Shallow, does not necessarily mean bad (at least not in this case). Just shallow.] as that. In reality, it’s almost always better to be goal oriented vs being profession oriented.

Why? Flexibility (or adaptivity, if that’s more your fancy).
Let’s have an example: the profession of a doctor. Compared to answering “I want to be a doctor,” would it not be a more flexible solution to say “I want to save people,” or cut people, or get $$$$, or get some prestige and flex to friends and family for some reason, or to satisfy your parent’s wants as opposed to living your ow life, or some other reason. We’ll use {saving lives} as the primary motivation here. 
If you wanted to save lives, you don’t have to be a doctor –there are plenty of other options that can directly or indirectly achieve this goal. You could be an epidemiologist. You could be a pilot + paramedic in a Flying Hospital (small airplane go brr to remote locations), a network engineer that focuses on remote places, the people that vaccinate and educate people in 3rd world countries (sorry, I forgot the names), considerably improving their survival chances and ability to become a skilled workforce (thus promoting economic growth, which personally is meh, or more importantly increasing the potential to produce useful items, which selfishly benefits you in the long term). You could also be a doctor (really!!??).
A simple change in the way you view and answer things can have drastic affects on how you view life. 

{add??? Probs not:
Of course, there is somewhat of a downside to a goal-oriented approach: It’s less traversed, there’s a more ambiguous path (due to flexibility) to reach the goal and the evaluation metric is a tad annoying to generate.
Although… Maybe not. Goals might be weird until you’ve achieved it, but then so are professions.

The rest is definitely my personal experience, and I haven’t really met anyone yet my age who has founded solid life goals. It should’ve been stated somewhere by now, but my goal is simple: solve intelligence. Simple to state, simple to know when it’s happened and yet stupendously difficult to execute. Perfect!’
To be honest, I’m not sure how I functioned for the past 17 years without a life goal. I’ve never tried this before, but I don’t think anything good would happen if you generated an AI or an RL agent with no goal to achieve, nothing to maximise. 
How do humans function without a life goal? Maybe goals are generated from the limbic system which lets you focus on the near-present and not the distant future, allowing you to perpetuate your existence as you fight against entropy in that small closed system [Obviously it’s not a closed system. First off, there’s a massive bloody hole going through you, and if you zoom in there’s even MORE HOLES. Isn’t everything just holes? And yet here we are.] you somewhat own.
Interestingly, a life goal appears to be extremely good against depression – as long as that goal is steeped in reasoning (I might talk about the reasoning in another post), you can knock the shitter pit of nihilism away easily. Sometimes you just have to tell that pit (and sometimes people) to ‘sugondese’. The future is the present. If there is likely a point in the future where you say ‘what a dumbshit, thinking about suicide’, it is probably a bad idea to commit suicide. -> Add ideas like these to a Pit of Nihilism post OH SHIT WE COULD DO THAT
Yet, people can function reasonably well without a too-far goal. If you have kids for instance, getting them to adulthood with a functional lifestyle, habits, ideas, etc. is a worthy enough goal that will take quite a bit of energy. And that’s fine. The point is to simply have a goal is worthy of yourself, and your time, and your effort.
