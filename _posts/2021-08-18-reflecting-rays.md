# The Original Question
```
Imagine a circular mirror with a radius of 5 that exists on an origin. 
A ray of light beings at 10i-10j and enters the mirror such that 
it intersects the point (-2, sqrt(29)). 
Assume that the mirror allows a ray to enter it before closing and thus trapping a light ray inside.

If an incoming ray hits a surface at an angle, 
it is reflected off the surface at the same angle to the normal (the law of reflection).

What is the point where the first reflected ray 
collides with the circular mirror (excluding the reflected ray's initial position)?

If you look back in history, this problem actually has some ancestry roots in a problem I was thinking about in grade 10 involving the reflection of  <a href="#" class="tooltip">light in a mirror <span> took me way too long to notice the simplest thing - I blame missing a lesson + only being taught a 'fixed' set of cases instead of the general system). </span> </a> Huh!


[^1]: Originally, the question was -10i-10j and point -2, -sqrt(29). There's a few errors with this (I had the wrong diagram in my head which caused me to get the wrong angle and be thoroughly confused for an hour or two until it clicked): 1) The point that the ray intersects is actually on the same side as the ray initialisation point, i.e it 'hits' the circle on the outside (which I then demand it to bounce off). I.e it never got inside. Lmao.
