# The Original Question
```
Imagine a circular mirror with a radius of 5 that exists on an origin. 
A ray of light beings at -10i, -10j and enters the mirror such that 
it intersects the point (-2, -sqrt(29)). 
Assume that the mirror allows a ray to enter it before closing and thus trapping a light ray inside.

If an incoming ray hits a surface at an angle, 
it is reflected off the surface at the same angle to the normal (the law of reflection).

What is the point where the first reflected ray 
collides with the circular mirror (excluding the reflected ray's initial position)?

$$mean = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{n}$$

$$ x = y^2 $$

If you look back in history, this problem actually has some ancestry roots in a problem I was thinking about in grade 10 involving the reflection of  <a href="#" class="tooltip">light in a mirror <span> took me way too long to notice the simplest thing - I blame missing a lesson + only being taught a 'fixed' set of cases instead of the general system). </span> </a> Huh!
