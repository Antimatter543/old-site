## Taboos and Sensitive Topics
Note:
A common trend for all of these (which is actually just talking about any topics in general), is only talk to them with people you **trust**. That goes for **any** topic. And obviously, if it's genuinely a sensitive topic, 


Some things in the world that are considered 'taboo' or inappropriate to talk about make no sense. For example,
the amount of money you have, your weight (women), your age (women), putting elbows on a table, etc. Not only are some of these (especially the women one) blatantly sexist, they also make NO FUCKING SENSE.

Obviously, if the person you're talking to has some sensitive topic (say, with weight, they've been through some fucked up harrassment, bullying, etc. that has caused them serious trauma), then of course you'd not talk about that. Or at least understand it's a sensitive topic and you should tread lightly. But that's not topic specific, you spazza (I mean this endearingly)! You talk about war with people, but would you talk about it in the same detail when the person has major PTSD.

In reality, topics (such as the women one) are only deemed sensitive (and elicit a genuine reaction out of people) because SOCIETY HAS DEEMED IT SENSITIVE, AND THE PERSON IN THAT SOCIETY HAS TAKEN UP THE CULTURE'S VALUES TO FIT IN. If you think about it from a logical basis, it makes exactly 0 sense. 

Are you serious? Let's talk about each of these individually.

<h3> Money </h3>
Often, the amount of money earnt is considered taboo. Why? Seriously. Give me some reasons. Would the people around you be jealous? *Why?* That's their problem, lol. And if they your friends, maybe rethink the definition of friend. Obviously, don't flaunt around "Oh yeah I make $150K per year" or some shit. That's dumb. But if someone asks you, why wouldn't you respond honestly?

Oh, they might talk behind your back? About what? You make more money, ok. Now what? Money != Happiness (although the first $60k definitely improves life satisfaction, but then the ratio of money:happiness decreases as you earn more).
If they start comparing their life to yours, their problem (once again). You do realise that the way you live (the actions you do) is much more telling than some wallop of cash you earn.
From <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-do-not-disclose-their-salary-to-others#:~:text=It%20is%20considered%20rude%20for,start%20comparing%20so%20many%20things."> this </a> article, talking about it is considered 'rude'. Literally why? Are you a fucking deg? THINK, MAN, THINK!

If you feel like you're gonna be negatively judged by the people, don't tell them... It's not that hard? It's just like anything else? A common trend for all of these (which is actually just talking about any topics in general), is only talk to them with people you **trust**.

<h4> Positives of talking about it </h4>

If the environment was more open to your salary, etc, then maybe wages would be fairer? Maybe the obscene act that wages haven't followed inflation for god knows how long would be fixed. You could argue for better job opportunities (<a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a28515/why-cant-we-talk-about-how-much-we-make/"> implying that not-talking about your salary may be a tactic from your company so you don't get better job offers, or aren't aware of them </a>).

<h3> Onto Women! </h3>

#### Weight
Yes, the title is a bit clickbaity, and I'm sure there's some men specific examples too (even these ones count, but for some reason this is more 'sensitive' to talk about for women). Let's start with weight. If you don't know that every model is photoshopped to the roof, and a decent amount of them suffer from anxiety for not having the perfect body, well, now you do. Shit's impossible. You can get a decent body by putting in the work, but yeah. Don't stress. 

Anyways, back to shitting on this. What the fuck is wrong with you? How is the number and constituating particles within your body at all offensive to you when you have no reason to be offended? Bro, I just want to know how much mass you have. Is that too much? I'm just asking man; maybe you can punch harder than expected or push with more force than I estimated, idk. I'm just trying to improve my estimation systems!

#### Age 
I'm sorry, did I scare you by asking you how contracted the length of your telomeres are?
{STILL WIP }

### Rude Manners

#### Elbows on Table
Seriously? Ok, say you think this. May I ask why? What is the logical derivation from some base set of fundamental morals you've assumed to reach the conclusion "Placing elbows on the table whilst eating is bad manners." This is just one you were told and accepted by someone with more authority than you without any push-back. Simple case; just throw it out of your system.


### Homosexuality

I wasn't gonna even put this in because it's so dumb to be against it if you created your own base set of fundamental morals and built up from there (see Useful Concepts blog). Oh no!!!! The majority of the world population still wants to fuck the other gender so there's no anti-population problems (i.e still enough babies are being made so humanity's not gonna fucking die out). But these like 10% of the population want to fuck each other in the ass or do the scissors thing, oh no! I'm not there to watch it, but I don't like it, oh no! Sucks. There's way worse shit going on in this messed up planet that is really not fun to think about, but people who tend to feel attracted towards something that's not conventional is too much? At worst, homosexuality is probably some glitchy brain wiring. Not all glitches are bad (that's literally the whole point of evolution). Being against gays is kinda like being against evolution; evo's just doing its shit man; how do you think you were made?

 That's all. Like, oh well, they wanna fuck their own gender. Who cares. Big deal. I only care about their potential and productivity and personality as a human being with ideas in their heads. People really stuck up over the smallest of things. "Oh that guy likes dick in his ass." Ok. Cool? I'd still fuckin resurrect Alan Turing any day of the week.

Just go about your day, that's literally it. Nobody's asking you to do anything. Just don't walk up to someone and say 'yeah fuck you for being this thing you can't change.' That's pretty cringe. Not just about homos, for anything. 

Side note: Don't gay people kinda help us with overpopulation problems? Most homo couples probably won't have kids. Like... Even though overpopulation won't really happen (it'll cap ~11 billion), isn't this just good?

### Racism
I just mentioned it above, so I might as well here. Honestly didn't even think about putting shit like this in, like, seriously? Being racist is cringe. It's pretty obvious that most of the differences in literally any quality of life / 'success' metric is based originally off of: environment born/raised in, economic status of immediate family (or the people you interact with), also the people you interact with (environment again). The genetic difference is fucking laughably miniscule, all it is is:

You:

- spawned in an OP starter area where you can level up really quickly and meet OP people (it's actually a major trading hub)
- just didn't have to re-invent the wheel about 10000 times
- have access to fast travel scrolls
- have access to the wiki of the game when other people don't
- can talk to level 100 people and get boosted easily
- have access to a global friends list 
- have more savepoints so if you mess up, you don't get booted into the fucking nether straight up.



### Math

Math isn't that bad, the way school taught you was. You can interpret maths in a lot of ways. One of the most practical ones: 

See it as tools. As a bunch of tools that can help you solve problems. What school didn't do but **really should** is give you some tangible, practical problem that you have no idea how to solve first. Then, reverse engineer from the solution to where you are now. You're gonna learn these fun little 'tools' or concepts called MATHS that make the problem a whole lot easier to break down.

Like, imagine tree fractal UIs on javascript (the p5js library). Wouldn't that be a cool way to learn about maths? Recursiveness, fractions, etc. And that's how you'd use it.

Instead of it being some arbitrary concept that has no use, it's now a tool you used to solve a problem to get this really cool result!
