Warning: This post contains swears.

Note:
A common trend for all of these (which is actually just talking about any topics in general), is only talk to them with people you **trust**. That goes for **any** topic. And obviously, if it's genuinely a sensitive topic, 


Some things in the world that are considered 'taboo' or inappropriate to talk about make no sense. For example,
the amount of money you have, your weight (women), your age (women), putting elbows on a table, etc. Not only are some of these (especially the women one) blatantly sexist, they also make NO FUCKING SENSE.

Obviously, if the person you're talking to has some sensitive topic (say, with weight, they've been through some fucked up harrassment, bullying, etc. that has caused them serious trauma), then of course you'd not talk about that. Or at least understand it's a sensitive topic and you should tread lightly. But that's not topic specific, you spazza (I mean this endearingly)! You talk about war with people, but would you talk about it in the same detail when the person has major PTSD.

In reality, topics (such as the women one) are only deemed sensitive (and elicit a genuine reaction out of people) because SOCIETY HAS DEEMED IT SENSITIVE, AND THE PERSON IN THAT SOCIETY HAS TAKEN UP THE CULTURE'S VALUES TO FIT IN. If you think about it from a logical basis, it makes exactly 0 sense. 

Are you serious? Let's talk about each of these individually.

<h3> Money </h3>
Often, the amount of money earnt is considered taboo. Why? Seriously. Give me some reasons. Would the people around you be jealous? *Why?* That's their problem, lol. And if they your friends, maybe rethink the definition of friend. Obviously, don't flaunt around "Oh yeah I make $150K per year" or some shit. That's dumb. But if someone asks you, why wouldn't you respond honestly?

Oh, they might talk behind your back? About what? You make more money, ok. Now what? Money != Happiness (although the first $60k definitely improves life satisfaction, but then the ratio of money:happiness decreases as you earn more).
If they start comparing their life to yours, their problem (once again). You do realise that the way you live (the actions you do) is much more telling than some wallop of cash you earn.
From <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-do-not-disclose-their-salary-to-others#:~:text=It%20is%20considered%20rude%20for,start%20comparing%20so%20many%20things."> this </a> article, talking about it is considered 'rude'. Literally why? Are you a fucking deg? THINK, MAN, THINK!

If you feel like you're gonna be negatively judged by the people, don't tell them... It's not that hard? It's just like anything else? A common trend for all of these (which is actually just talking about any topics in general), is only talk to them with people you **trust**.

<h4> Positives of talking about it </h4>

If the environment was more open to your salary, etc, then maybe wages would be fairer? Maybe the obscene act that wages haven't followed inflation for god knows how long would be fixed. You could argue for better job opportunities (<a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a28515/why-cant-we-talk-about-how-much-we-make/"> implying that not-talking about your salary may be a tactic from your company so you don't get better job offers, or aren't aware of them </a>).

<h3> Onto Women! </h3>

Yes, the title is a bit clickbaity, and I'm sure there's some men specific examples too (even these ones count, but for some reason this is more 'sensitive' to talk about for women). Let's start with weight. If you don't know that every model is photoshopped to the roof, and a decent amount of them suffer from anxiety for not having the perfect body, well, now you do. Shit's impossible. You can get a decent body by putting in the work, but yeah. Don't stress. 

Anyways, back to shitting on this. What the fuck is wrong with you? How is the number and constituating particles within your body at all offensive to you when you have no reason to be offended? Bro, I just want to know how much mass you have. Is that too much? I'm just asking man; maybe you can punch harder than expected or push with more force than I estimated, idk. I'm just trying to improve my estimation systems!
