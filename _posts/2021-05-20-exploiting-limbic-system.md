This is very old... It's written by me from grade 9/10, and I *may* have been under the influence of endogenous opiods (fancy term for stuff that attaches to opiod receptors in you) such as dopamine (the motivation neurotransmitter) and norepinephrine among others (look, I'm not neurologist I don't know what stuff gets released when you have a crush.). I haven't had the time to edit and refine it yet (although I excluded personal details). If you're seeing this, hello..? Read at your own risk. And please, don't be too harsh.

 I’ve used this strategy before with S1 in grade 9, and it’s incredibly productive. What I mean by productive is useful to yourself i.e useful to the world. Includes increased intelligence (of all kinds), increased health quality, etc. 

I guess a way of explaining it is basically like gravity, or slingshotting yourself. Gravity assist! Imagine you’re going towards the goal or whatever [the planet], use its gravity to slingshot yourself into faster speed and get a head start.

Ok, let’s try examples. Say, for instance, your limbic system is like “Holy shit I really want to talk to this person as much as possible”, you would then want to increase your physical appearance attractivity, improve your social connectability, etc. 

Let’s take physical appearance. Of course, people like people who are fit!
[^1]See Olympic villages for examples of this. So what should you do? 

Get fitter. Exercise, pushups, walk, run, jog, whatever. Increase muscle mass, endurance, stamina, etc. Become healthier by eating better. Now, your limbic system thinks that this is all to go bingbongbingbong and go bang bang but you know in the back of your head, with a little guilty smile, as you outmaneuveur nature, that you’re actually increasing your physical stats for the increased endurance, stamina etc, but more importantly, for the goddamn INCREASED BOOST IN INTELLIGENCE IT GIVES YOU, THE INCREASED HAPPINESS AND REDUCED DEPRESSION, LET’S FUCKING GO! Since you know, the fitter you are generally, the more active your brain is, your hippocampus actually increases in size which leads to better memory, your reduced depression and increased happiness/satisfaction in life is great for your mental health (leading to better and more creative ideas, stronger resilience, etc.). Increased fitness also means you have opened more physical possibilities[^toyingfootnotes] and essentially a longer lifespan to do what you need.

 Let me rephrase, you are not actually outsmarting nature, she is still getting what she wants, it’s just you’ve managed to find a way that both you (like the you that has true goals in life) and nature (bang bang) both benefit from this, and you’re simply leading yourself in such a way that what you do benefits your (complex/conscious human mind imagination thing) life more than it would have.

So, when you have a crush, or your limbic system is going insane (say it’s hungry), try to sneak in some positive ulterior motives in there too, while encouraging it that you are in fact doing what it wants, since you know, for some reason the limbic system controls the cortex and not the other way around. Like, ???

In the case of hungry for example, you might be able to get yourself to ‘quickly do the bed’, or ‘finish off this last paragraph’ of your assignment before you go grab a snack. Hey, when your limbic system is fired up, you have access to so much more than you could have without it. Well… It would just be  harder to get the same enthusiasm or motivation or whatnot (unless you had a different brain that functioned perfectly fine without the limbic and could 100% control any emotions (e.g turn full angry -> productivity, or feel perfectly calm whenever, or only feel like you wanna go bang bang when you’re about to go bang bang, etc.))


[^1]: It is better to tell your brain this to get the outcome which is your increased fitness.
[^toyingfootnotes]: By means of travelling – you can go faster, go through rougher terrain, etc.
