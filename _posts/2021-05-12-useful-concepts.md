Just some of the terminology I consider useful in life & general. There's a few definitions here as well as some (in my opinion) useful concepts.

**Intelligence**: The ability to acquire and apply knowledge with respect to achieving a goal. I will therefore define intelligence as anything that can have memory as well as use the memory. 
It should be noted that intelligence is not required to achieve a goal. A basic computer virus is not intelligent (it just executes the same script over and over again), but 'intelligent' humans (entites capable of receiving new information and learning) can still suffer losses to one. Lost to virus omegalul. 

**Subsets** - A is a subset of B therefore B contains all of A. Americans are a subset of humans, for example. {...}Such a good word.
