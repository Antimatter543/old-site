Just some of the terminology I consider useful in life & general. There's a few definitions here as well as some (in my opinion) useful concepts. These usually follow the order of:

Item: Definition of item.

Explanation.


**Fundamental / Level 0 / Base Morals**: Axioms (base assumptions) about reality that you build your morals from by applying first principles (logic).

 Loosely applying Godel's incompleteness thereom (yes I'm probably using it wrong), given any axioms we cannot prove that it's consistent or something. So, you're gonna have to make an assumption about your ethics/morals *somewhere*. What people usually do is to adapt other people's (usually those with authority - parents, etc.) into their own system. Now, the issue with this is that barely any of these people have actually reasoned from first principles (we'll just call it logic from now on), and instead have just yoinked from their authority figures. This leads to dumb rules that make absolutely no sense usually in the name of 'tradition'. Instances of this are: Elbows on the table being bad manners, age/weight of women being sensitive topics, talking about your salary being inappropriate, etc.

The reason people do this heuristic method instead of thinking with logic (first principles) is simple: It takes less energy to do so. After making your initial assumption, deriving high-level morals and ethics from this takes a fuck ton of work and energy; most people simply can't be bothered with it. So their whole tinted colour of reality is based off some shitty stuck-together heuristic that breaks apart within ~2-5 steps of counterarguments (logic which tests the strength of an argument).

My suggestion: Take some of the following base morals and build from there (use these as your bedrock): Don't be a dick (or be as least of a dick to others + yourself as you can be). Something like this (I didn't think too long on this; spend more time on it).

**R/E** - Reward per unit of energy. 

I use this as an evaluation tool on any given topic/concept/plan to see whether the potential rewards are worth the energy spent. If R/E is low (e.g barely any reward for the amount of energy spent), I just move on with my life. Examples would be arguing against anti-vax or flat earthers and the like. I just don't care enough. Maybe someone else will. If the R/E is high, then the task moves high on the priority list of things to do. It should be noted that different people will have different Reward/Energy values for the same topic because their process of calculating reward and energy spent are different.

An example of using R/E is my Grade 12 scores. In the QCAA currently, ATAR works by calculating your 5 highest subjects (we have 6) After getting a poopy mark on English and better in all other subjects by a fair margin, I decided the R/E wasn't high enough to try and optimise for marks because trying to LINK BACK TO AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY and the marking criteria was not fun. Instead, I opted to *enjoy* the subject, and write things how *I* wanted it. So, I optimised english for my experience and enjoyment as opposed to marks, because chances were it was going to be my lowest scaling subject. This increased my person enjoyment (reward) for English, but the main consequence was reducing the subjective amount of energy needed (unsure about true energy because didn't collect data) to do the subject. So now, I can write things that I'm proud of knowing that I give 0 shits about a mark.

(As a side note, my R/E for AGI is infinite since the reward is effectively infinite).

**Subsets** - A is a subset of B therefore B contains all of A. Americans are a subset of humans, for example. {...}Such a good word.

Below is ??? not done very wip 
**Intelligence**: The ability to acquire and apply knowledge with respect to achieving a goal. I will therefore define intelligence as anything that can have memory as well as use the memory. 
It should be noted that intelligence is not required to achieve a goal. A basic computer virus is not intelligent (it just executes the same script over and over again), but 'intelligent' humans (entites capable of receiving new information and learning) can still suffer losses to one. Lost to virus omegalul. Even with this definition, there's some cases where I don't really agree with..? Intelligence is too broad what the hell lol?
