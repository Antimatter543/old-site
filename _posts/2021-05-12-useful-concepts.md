Just some of the terminology I consider useful in life & general. There's a few definitions here as well as some (in my opinion) useful concepts.

**Intelligence**: The ability to acquire and apply knowledge with respect to achieving a goal. I will therefore define intelligence as anything that can have memory as well as use the memory. 


**Subsets** - A is a subset of B therefore B contains all of A. Americans are a subset of humans, for example. {...}Such a good word.
