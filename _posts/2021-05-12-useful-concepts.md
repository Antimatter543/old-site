Just some of the terminology I consider useful in life & general. There's a few definitions here as well as some (in my opinion) useful concepts.

**Fundamental / Level 0 / Base Morals**: Loosely applying Godel's incompleteness thereom (yes I'm probably using it wrong), given any axioms we cannot prove that it's consistent or something. So, you're gonna have to make an assumption about your ethics/morals *somewhere*. What people usually do is to adapt other people's (usually those with authority - parents, etc.) into their own system. Now, the issue with this is that barely any of these people have actually reasoned from first principles (we'll just call it logic from now on), and instead have just yoinked from their authority figures. This leads to dumb rules that make absolutely no sense usually in the name of 'tradition'. Instances of this are: Elbows on the table being bad manners, age/weight of women being sensitive topics, talking about your salary being inappropriate, etc.

The reason people do this heuristic method instead of thinking with logic (first principles) is simple: It takes less energy to do so. After making your initial assumption, deriving high-level morals and ethics from this takes a fuck ton of work and energy; most people simply can't be bothered with it. So their whole tinted colour of reality is based off some shitty stuck-together heuristic that breaks apart within ~2-5 steps of counterarguments (logic which tests the strength of an argument).

My suggestion: Take some of the following base morals and build from there (use these as your bedrock): Don't be a dick (or be as least of a dick to others + yourself as you can be). Something like this (I didn't think too long on this; spend more time on it).

**Intelligence**: The ability to acquire and apply knowledge with respect to achieving a goal. I will therefore define intelligence as anything that can have memory as well as use the memory. 
It should be noted that intelligence is not required to achieve a goal. A basic computer virus is not intelligent (it just executes the same script over and over again), but 'intelligent' humans (entites capable of receiving new information and learning) can still suffer losses to one. Lost to virus omegalul. Even with this definition, there's some cases where I don't really agree with..? Intelligence is too broad what the hell lol?

**Subsets** - A is a subset of B therefore B contains all of A. Americans are a subset of humans, for example. {...}Such a good word.
