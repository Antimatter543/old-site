During my second year of realising that a thing called **programming** existed, one of our school assignments was to make a game. Now, almost everybody in the class didn't even bother making the most basic platformer which was enough to get an A, but, who am I to care for a grade?
If I'm gonna spend time doing something, you best believe I'm gonna enjoy the final product. 

And thus, Frame of War was made (I might've been playing a lot of Warframe at the time).

It's the first game I've ever made, and it's also annoying to beat. Below is a video of me completing it. Skip to X if you want to get to the good part.

For an extra challenge, I decided to beat the game without any lasers. Even though the (spoilers) boss has some anti-laser mechanisms so you can't spam lasers to kill it (to a certain degree), the masochist in me decided "Hey, this game isn't hard enough. Let's beat it without this feature that I spent time adding in!". So that's what I did.

The first 2 levels are meant to be easy - to pull you off your guard. The 3rd level is also simple as long as you stay in the center; if you don't, you're going to meet hell. It looked obvious to me, but the people who played always moved away and er... Having 3 big aliens on your screen is not the best idea.

This took me X attempts to get a video; and I'm the only person that has beaten this so far. Even though the timings and abilities were coded *by me*, the final boss is still difficult. 
I made the level music from Musenet (OpenAI's music agent). 
Boss music from Fatima (Stein;s Gate). 

If you want to try it yourself, download the exe. There's a version where you use arrow keys to move, and another where you use the mouse.

{host .exe somewhere}

Yes, that sounds like a virus. No, it's probably not a virus. Yes, if your antivirus goes haywire just listen to it. Maybe there's a way I can host it on the website?
