<h2> Introduction </h2>

I implore you to look around.

<img src="/assets/spacex.jpg" alt="Image of Spacex rocket trails.">

The phone or computer you're reading this on; its circuitry, the software, the UI. The building you're in, the roads outside, the internet, cities, nations. Schools of education and all the knowledge in the world; it was all founded by humanity. You have weapons that can end civilisation, and rockets that can expand them.

And the only reason humanity has made it this far is because they were *really horny* for a consistently long period of time.


This only came to my mind after reading Love Is War. *What*. My world perspective was shifted by a text (although not the first time). This observation is so obvious and only requires 1 step of thinking, but I've never even though about this domain at all.

<h2> Rationale </h2>
Given that humanity has only reached this point by the consistent fornification (I just mean 'fucking' here) over a large period of time, it suggests that the future of humanity is also reliant on this process. Thus, the entire topic of attraction actually appears to be quite an important one - one that is often thrown under the rug and deemed private or sensitive whathaveyou. 

<img src="/assets/horni.png" alt="A great timeline image drawn by me in paint." width="90%">

And fair play to that, but... Shouldn't this topic be more openly discussed in public forums, i.e places of public discussion. Should the science and psychology of attraction/crushes/love not be taught in schools for at least a bit, just like sex education is?

Like yes, sex is a thing. Yes, STDs bad, yes use protection. But seeing as quite a large percentage of the people you're talking to are going to end up in at least some type of relationship, isn't it good to teach them about boundaries, the general process of dating, being in a healthy relationship, learning how to fight (because fights will happen), etc.? It feels criminal to leave such a large topic of humanity's reason of being here away from public eyes to learn from.

Seriously, when do we learn about relationships? Why do we have to go through the horrible process of picking god awful matches, breakups, cheating, bad fighting, just because society deemed it 'weird' to talk and exchange information about the topic in public. Fuck you, weird's good! Before now (gaining that observation I started the blog with), I haven't really thought a lot about this whole scene of attraction/relationships. Yeah, the 'exploiting your limbic system' is a thing as well as a few simulated conversations of being with someone whomst I enjoy but that's not this topic at all.

Tl;dr: Democratise the knowledge of relationships! Make it public domain and professionaly taught as opposed to only knowledge gained from close peers/family. 

This has led me to collect data on crushes (or limerence). Now, relationships & crushes don't relate too directly, but they were close enough that I thought, "Why not?" To increase my knowledge of this domain (of crushes) will indirectly help me when I'll have to deal with relationships / attraction in the future. How, I'm not sure. But more data helps. And also, it's nice to just increase your knowledge on any particular topic. Perhaps this has been slightly influenced as I ~~currently~~ just had an object of limerence, but... Fuck it. This is still interesting on its own.


Side note: so much brain power is invested into how to get laid (the dumb brain controls the smart brain a lot of the time, see <a href="LEX FRIDMAN ELON MUSTK VIDEO I couldn't find the timestamp so just watch them both. It might also have been a Joe Rogan podcast?"> this Lex Fridman podcast.</a> Also related to Exploiting the limbic system (another post).))


<h2> Accumulation of Data </h2>

<h3> Methodology </h3>
I just went around and asked people in real life (all in school) about these. Initially, I didn't have a set of questions to ask so I just asked general ones, but I systemised the method into the following questions:
<ul>
<li> How many crushes have you had (and currently have), if any? </li>
<li> What was the average duration of your crushes?</li>
<li> What was the shortest/longest duration you've had for one?</li>
<li> Was it an instant thing or did the crush take time to form?</li>
</ul>

For those who I asked before the questions were created, the time between gathering the info and recording it is extended so there might be some incorrect info here. Of course, if they didn't want to answer, they didn't have to.

Notes: Only 1 female was surveyed. All surveyed individuals are not randomly picked individual, this is not a representative sample of the population. This is a representative sample of the types of people I feel comfortable speaking to (i.e am somewhat at least friends with) about just walking up to them and asking "How many crushes have you had?" No, I'm not going to make a random selection. 

<h3> Results </h3>
Here's a table of the results as of ~May 2021. This applies only to the number of crushes people have had in high school or before, except for our boy S (who's a virtual friend of mine). He's a bit older than high school (let's say somewhere mid 20s), so he's got a bit more.

| Person | # of Crushes | Average Crush Duration | Shortest/Longest Duration of Crush | Instant or Delayed Crush Formation | Notes|
|--------|--------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------|
| **Me** | 3 | A year | A few months / 2 years (only 1 case; it was on/off. Instead of switching the person of limerence, it just switched on/off same person) | Gradual until it hit (~few months-year) | Detailed notes in extra. ~Grade 10, 11, 12|
| 2 | 2 | ~6 months | At least 6 months | Gradual formation | Grade 6, 10 for crushes. | 
| 3 | 3 | ~1 years  | 6 months / 1.5 years | Mix | Year 6,7,7. Sometimes has a dream and gets really into someone for 1 week before it fades. |
| 4 | 0 | NA | NA | NA | Balling. 0 Crushes madlad. Lowkey late sleeper |
| 5 | 4 | 6-12 months | Few weeks / 3-4 years | Gradual | None |
| 6 | 4 | ~1 year | Similar to average | Gradual | All crushes before high school. *Sus*. Taking their word for it.
|7 | 5 | 9 months (school year) | 3 months / 1.5 years | Instant | Mostly Yr 9-12 |
|8| 10 | 2 months | 1 week/ 1 year. | Usually instant | Mostly middle school | 
| 9 (Virtual friend) | ~10 | NA | NA | Mix, but as time increases, more often gradual | NA x2 because didn't ask | 
| 10 | 2 | 2-3 months | 1 month / 4 months | Gradual | Middle school; years 8-9. | 
| 11 | 6 | ~4-5 months | 1 month / ~8 months | Mostly instant | One per year usually |
| 12 |  11 | 2 months | 2 days / 5 months | Mix instant/gradual | Over the course of high school |
| 13 | 5 | 5 months | 1 month / 9 months (school year) | Gradual | Most recent grade 10 | 

I should've asked this question too, but here's some anecdotal answers that I got after speaking to some of the people about this, "Why were you attracted to those people?". Common answers were: similar personalities, hobbies, interests, etc.

Side note: I had to talk to people I don't usually talk to because the opportunity presented itself, and I'm not going to deny free data am I?


## Analysis, Evaluation and Conclusions

After looking at the data for a bit, it seems there's a few patterns here. Obviously, there's some cases where this completely doesn't apply but here we go. Shoutout to #4 for having **0** crushes throughout their existence so all the other questions were rendered moot.

The average number of crushes is ~2-4 people (excluding the two 10s), and everybody asked is at least in grade 12. #9 is just a bonus (approx. 25yrs; a bit older than final year high school). I am the only one whose information is public because I'm fucking insane and apparently have nothing to lose.

The most popular time to have crushes was around Year 7-11, and second most common was tied between primary (#6 is the Sus outlier here) & consistent throughout high school. Most crush formations were gradual, although there were some mixes and instants. Instants did slightly tend to have more crushes, although not by much. Obviously, increases in sample size will make this data more valid. Usually the longest crushes lasted at least a year.

The average crush duration was either ~1 school year (9-12 months) or ~4 months. I'm somewhat of an outlier by having more crushes during the later stages of life as opposed to the earlier ones, and my duration of crush formation is a bit longer than average.

An explanation for the lack of crushes during senior school (Years 10-12) could be from increased workload + less life/work/health balance, increased stress (from factors ranging from career to uni selection to 'do I stay with my parents'), etc.

### Conclusion
Well, there you go. I had some fun making this, talked to some people I don't usually talk to and made some potential insights into a topic that's not really talked about. Huh!



## Extra - My experiences
At this point, if you've read the data and don't care about my own personal experience, you can leave. I'm just gonna note down my own experiences with crushes here. This doesn't really offer anything other than a different perspective into the thing, so yep! I have suffered leaving my own experiences out here so YOU PEOPLE CAN GET FREE DATA, REMEMBER THE SUFFERING I HAVE ENDURED.

"Clickbait (but technically true): They scored higher than I did in some subject at some time (although most people probably did at some point)"

I am aware this is a type of social suicide, but that being said, fuck you. What are you gonna do with the info? Tell people? Who? You don't even know who it is, and even if you do, I **know who you are**. Knowledge must be shared with the world, and how will they learn if there is nobody willing to risk something?


### First things first

I swear I'm not that shallow that intelligence is the only thing I take into account PLEASE! It was just an attempt at clickbaiting you people into being like "Oh so grades are the only thing he cares about." No! I SWEAR DUDE HOLY FK IT JUST LOOKS BAD THAT'S IT. There's a few other common characteristics between all 3 crushes, but I chose to state that one because it's kinda the funniest one lmao.

Anyways, looking at my own experiences, it seems that there's a few things to consider:

1. They have to be respectable. It doesn't matter if they have the equivalent intelligence of 500000x Albert Einsteins; if I can't respect them as a person, it's an instant nope.

2. I might have a thing towards intelligence / work ethic / perseverance.

3. Some other factors (probably hormonal, how much workload I'm under, etc. Just normal things that other people also have).

### Funny observation:
This is a really nice benefit actually, and I'm not sure if other people experience this to the same degree I do, but  physical attractiveness based on some evaluation metric (like personality, compatibility -> hobbies, interests, ethics, morals, etc.) changes once I get to know them better. Like it *really* changes physical attractiveness.

I'll go through the example with S2 (secondary crush; this would be Grade 10-11). Let's assume I have a physical attraction metric. On initial meeting, I would have rated (purely on physical attractiveness) a 4/10. That's like, top 60%. It was in a physics class, and I deemed her 'a bit too polite' after our first conversation. However, as mutual time in an enclosed space increased, I realised *I've been jebaited*.  Anyways, come a physics data test FIA1, and she gets a 10/10, I 9/10 (lost the 10 by not rounding). Sometime between then and next term (i.e Term 2 grade 10), I realise that just by pure physical attraction, she's an 8/10; top 10%. On physical only. Wtf??? Obviously, nothing happened and it died out after ~7-9 months.
