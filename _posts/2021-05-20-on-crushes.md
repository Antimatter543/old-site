~~{I implore you to look around.
Start off with the realisation that humanity only got to this point was because they were *really horny* for a consistently long period of time.
I learnt this from kaguya-sama. Seriously. *What*. My world perspective was shifted by anime (although not the first time). This observation is so obvious and only requires 1 step of thinking, but I've never even though about this domain at all.


| Priority apples | Second priority | Third priority |
|-------|--------|---------|
| ambrosia | gala | red delicious |
| pink lady | jazz | macintosh |
| honeycrisp | granny smith | fuji |

By logic, if we've gotte here by being constantly horny and wanting to fuck all the time, that means humans (or at least in my experience) are doing **criminal** activity by not letting crushes / love being talked about as an open subject.


Like seriously, in school, I barely talk about them. Like god, so much brain power is invested into how to get laid (the dumb brain controls the smart brain a lot of the time, see <a href="LEX FRIDMAN ELON MUSTK VIDEO"> this Lex Fridman podcast.</a> Also related to Exploiting the limbic system (another post).))

Now, what the hell do crushes do?
{This links with exploiting limbic system!}} ~~


Sample size 7:
I've anonymised all the data so you can't tell anyone on the list (except for me, because I'm giving consent for this info to be public). For some of the people, I asked them before I had a structure of questions to ask, and the time between gathering the info and recording it was extended so there might be some incorrect info here.

Here's a table of the results as of ~May 2021.

How many crushes have you had, if any? What was the average duration of your crushes? What was the shortest/longest duration you've had for one? Was it an instant thing or did the crush take time to form?

| Person | # of Crushes | Average Crush Duration | Shortest/Longest Duration of Crush | Instant or Delayed Crush Formation |
|-------|--------|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Me** | 3 | A year | A few months / A few years (on and off, it's not that weird fuck you! And that wsa only one case.) | Every instance took a long time (at least a few months) until I realised. | 


Other way of table;

<table>
  {% for row in site.data.crushes %}
    {% if forloop.first %}
    <tr>
      {% for pair in row %}
        <th>{{ pair[0] }}</th>
      {% endfor %}
    </tr>
    {% endif %}

    {% tablerow pair in row %}
      {{ pair[1] }}
    {% endtablerow %}
  {% endfor %}
</table>

K man:
3 -- ..? Need to ask again.

A man:
2 - (Grade 6 & 10).
Non-instant, lasted at least 6 months (1/2 a year -> grade 10). Took time to form (gradual).

C man (he is the man):
~4 - All primary school, none current / high school (kinda odd.). Average duration was ~1 year.
Gradual realisation (not instant).



M boi (next to me in team):
3 - need more data. Note: Has crush on someone who has a bf.

J:
0 crushes. All other questions are irrelevant. Man's ruthless. Ask again, wtf?


note: only 1 female was surveyed. All surveyed individuals are not randomly picked individual, this is not a representative sample of the population. This is a representative sample of the types of people I feel comfortable speaking to (i.e am somewhat at least friends with) about just walking up to them and asking "How many crushes have you had?"
