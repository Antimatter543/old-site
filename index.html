<h1> Quick About </h1>

Home page: Mini-summary of the entire site, I guess. 
<p>I'm Antimatter, a guy. I do things sometimes. <a href="/about"> Some random text that links to /about</a></p>
I enjoy a lot of things, and have recently (2019 onwards) rekindled my passion for reading. 


{Get rid of about.md and just put stuff here instead? }

<h1> Favourite Projects </h1>
{Well.. Probably my only projects right now would be my favourite projects}

<h1>Blog</h1>
This website was created around February 2021, and is continually updated as I... update it.
However, you'll notice that some of the blog posts are pre-2021. This is just because that's the date when I had originally explored the concept. 
If you click on the article, the most recent date where it's been reviewed will show (which is when it was published here).

<ul class="posts">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
        <li>
            {% if post.includelink %}
            <span class="post-date">{{ post.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</span> <a href="{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.title }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
            <br>
                {% if post.excerpt %}
                <p> {{ post.excerpt }} </p>
                {% endif %}
            {% endif %}
        </li>	
    {% endfor %}
</ul>

This site has been <em> creatively inspired </em> by many other websites (>7), but I'll name the first few that have been inspired from the most:
karpathy.github.io
https://www.christopherlovell.co.uk/
Jekyll Minima 
https://github.com/hankquinlan/hankquinlan.github.io/
{That other thing for the projects page}
