<h1> Quick About </h1>

I'm Antimatter, or Yuv, and I do things sometimes. This website works as both a nice place to store my projects as well as explanations / concepts that I might be exploring.
I tend to do a lot of 'nibbles' at different things, which means that I don't actually go far enough into for it to be worth writing a post about, but still pick up some nice skills along the way.

<h1> Favourite Projects </h1>
Right now, I don't really have enough projects to call any my favourite. However, the Coder One Hackathon and Frame of War are pretty cool <a href='/projects'> (you should check them out).</a>

<h1>Blog</h1>
This website was created around February 2021, and is continually updated as I... update it.
However, you'll notice that some of the blog posts are pre-2021. This is just because that's the date when I had originally explored the concept. 
If you click on the article, the most recent date where it's been reviewed will show (which is when it was published here).

<ul class="posts">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
        <li>
            {% if post.includelink %}
            <span class="post-date">{{ post.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</span> <a href="{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.title }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
            <br>
                {% if post.excerpt %}
                <p> {{ post.excerpt }} </p>
                {% endif %}
            {% endif %}
        </li>	
    {% endfor %}
</ul>

This site has been <em> creatively inspired </em> by many other websites (>7), but I'll name the first few that have been inspired from the most:
<p>karpathy.github.io</p>

<p>https://www.christopherlovell.co.uk/</p>
<p> Jekyll Minima </p>
<p> https://github.com/hankquinlan/hankquinlan.github.io/</p>
<p>{That other thing for the projects page}  </p>
