 So, in our index.html, the stuff between --- is called 'front matter'; anything with the --- --- will be processed by Jekyll.
 So every file with layout: default will generate the full HTML doc by replacing {{content}} in _layouts/defaults.html with the contents of the file. POG

 AHHH:
 page.title refers to the 'title' in --- X --- for that page.
 site.posts refers to the _posts folder in the site directory (I think). Pog!
 There's a way  to test this:
 just add page.layout in some text so see what shows up (theoretically, if you put this in default.html, 
 the home page (index.html on the main (site) directory) should show up with 'default' wherever you put page.layout)
 
 ::IT DOES IT DOES I UNDERSTAND THE THINGS I UNDERSTAND!!!!!!!!!!!!::

 Here's why you made a folder called 'blog', then put index.html in it.
 Basically, on the main page you have a thing going to /blog (which would be a folder). In this folder, you have the index.html, which is the thing that the website reads first or whatever. Basically, you could've also had the main page link to blog.html (also on the main directory), but these are the same thing.
 I guess it looks neater this way. Yeah.

 Oh, by main page I guess I meant default.html.

 I guess I don't like when everything's on one page, so I will have different .md's. 
 But, I kinda don't really want to make folders and put index.html for each thing (cv, etc.).
 On second thoughts, why not?


Page title overrides site title from head.html
