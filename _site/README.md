If you are reading this, you've caught me with my pants down, as they say. Please stop looking. I'll finish up the new site by the 20th Feb 2023 hopefully ðŸ˜­

 Also, whenever I look at the github.io's of websites, it's mildly annoying how there's never a link to the actual website, so you have to search it up. Oh no, +5 seconds! Anyways, here's the link:

 <h1> https://antimatter543.github.io/ </h1>
 
 Jekyll makes it so that instead of having to change URLS, etc. for every single site, you can make a default.html and then import that into the index, etc. And that's just one of the things it can do! PogChamp.


Posts need both includelink and a tag (professional or non-professional) to be visible. The "published" tag is a bool. On true, you can see it on site. On false, you can't (even if you know the url).
